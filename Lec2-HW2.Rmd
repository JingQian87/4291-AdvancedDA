# Part1. Script in Slides CRD




This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
fat = c(rep("fat1",6),rep("fat2",6),rep("fat3",6),rep("fat4",6))
amount = c(264,272,268,277,290,276,278,291,297,282,285,277,275,286,278,271,263,276,255,266,248,264,270,268)
data = data.frame(fat,amount)
summary(data[,2][data[,1]=='fat1'])
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
